# Log

Log library is the one-header-only library that provides the log of any text to the console and to the given file simultaneously. Thread-safety is guaranteed (or at least should be).
Also the VersionRetriever class is provided to acquire product version from file (used for the welcome logger message).

Class usage is briefly described in the Log.h file.
